# This is a README file for C - Debugging Task.

### Task 0. Multiple mains
Create a file named 0-main.c. This file must test that the function positive_or_negative() gives the correct output when given a case of 0.

### Task 1. Like, comment, subscribe
Comment out (donâ€™t delete it!) the part of the code that is causing the output to go into an infinite loop.

### Task 2. 0 > 972?
Fix the code in 2-largest_number.c so that it correctly prints out the largest of three numbers, no matter the case.

### Task 3. Leap year
Fix the print_remaining_days() function so that the output works correctly for all dates and all leap years.
